/**
 * Complimentary unlock codes for Wren.
 *
 * Wren's paid feature is a one-time purchase. This lets a named person — a
 * friend, a tester, App Review — have it without paying, using a code that
 * works once and then does not.
 *
 * The reason this is a server at all: single use cannot be enforced on the
 * device. A code could be signed and checked offline with an embedded public
 * key, needing nothing here, but then one code pasted into a group chat
 * unlocks the app for everyone who reads it, and nothing on a phone can know a
 * code has already been spent somewhere else. "Already redeemed" is a fact
 * that has to live in one place.
 *
 * What the app gets back is an Ed25519-signed token naming the device. That
 * matters twice over: the app checks its entitlement offline forever after,
 * and pointing the app at a look-alike server achieves nothing, because a
 * forged "yes" cannot carry a valid signature.
 *
 * A code carries a role, and they form a ladder. 'unlock' is guides and
 * exports uncapped, which is what every code was before roles existed.
 * 'everything' is that plus places read out of a shared reel — the thing that
 * costs money on every use, which is why it is not simply given to every code.
 * 'admin' is everything plus the right to issue and withdraw codes, so the
 * person who runs Wren can hand out an unlock from a phone instead of a
 * terminal, and so nobody else can, because the app shows no trace of the
 * console without an administrator's token.
 *
 * The token an administrator holds is a bearer credential for /admin/*, but it
 * is not the whole of the decision: every administrative request re-reads the
 * code's role from D1. That is deliberate. Unlock entitlements are checked
 * offline forever, so withdrawing one is impossible; withdrawing an
 * administrator has to be possible, and it is, because the table is consulted
 * rather than the signature alone.
