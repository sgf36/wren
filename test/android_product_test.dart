/// What Wren is on a phone with no Apple Maps.
///
/// One thing follows from that absence: there is no guide to publish, so the
/// main button hands the list to another map app instead.
///
/// What does NOT follow — and this file used to say it did — is that there is
/// nothing to sell. The two stores carry one product at one price, and the unit
/// being sold is "more than three places at once", which both platforms have.
/// A free tier that differed by platform would make these two different apps
/// wearing one name. So the cap applies to the hand-off exactly as it applies
/// to publishing, and `com.spencerfields.littlebird.unlimited` must exist in
/// Play Console as well as App Store Connect.
///
/// The complimentary-code path needs no platform work: the box, the device
/// identifier it redeems against, the admin console and the entitlement
/// recomposition were all already ungated. What was missing was a cap for a
/// code to lift, and that is what changed.
///
/// Every test below pins `canMakeGuides` rather than trusting the platform,
/// because the suite runs on a desktop where neither branch is the default.

/// A place with a coordinate, so it can be written into a file as well as
/// matched — the two are different questions, and only the first reaches
/// another map app.
