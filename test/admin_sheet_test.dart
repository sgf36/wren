/// Two separate claims, and the first is the one that matters most. A device
/// without an admin code must find nothing — not a locked control, not a
/// greyed-out row, not a second dialog asking for a password. The long press
/// that has always opened the code box must go on opening the code box.
///
/// The other direction cannot be pumped here: reaching the console requires a
/// token signed by the Worker's private key, which is the point of it and is
/// not in this repository. So the gate is proved shut here, proved to open only
/// for a valid signature in `comp_unlock_test.dart`, and the console itself is
/// exercised directly below with the network injected.
