# Wren

*A little bird told me.* Turns screenshots into Apple Maps guides — the places
people tell you about, kept somewhere you'll find them.

The bundle id is `com.spencerfields.littlebird` and the OCR method channel is
`littlebird/ocr`. Both are deliberate leftovers from the app's first name: the
App ID, provisioning profile and every shipped build are bound to that
identifier, and it is invisible to users. Renaming it would cost a new App ID,
a new profile and a new App Store record for no benefit.

Scaffold only — the pipeline is wired end to end, but place resolution is a stub
until a Maps Server API key exists.

## Why Flutter, given the target is iOS

There is no Mac on this project. Flutter runs on Windows, so the list screens,
the picker and the confirmation flow all hot-reload locally; only the iOS build
needs a macOS CI runner. Native Swift would be the better choice with a Mac and
is the worse one without.

Exactly one Swift file exists — `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`, which bridges
Vision for OCR. It has no interface, so it never needs a simulator.

## What is proven and what is not

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Guide-link encoding | **Verified.** Tests assert byte-for-byte against links opened on a physical iPhone that populated real guides. |
| OCR | **Measured** at 25/25 on graded synthetic frames using Vision `.accurate`. Real reel typography is untested. |
| Chrome filtering / place picking | Heuristic. Tested against a realistic line set, but the "largest text wins" rule comes from frames we authored. |
| Resolution | **Stubbed.** `StubResolver` returns real, device-verified place ids so the rest of the app runs. |
| Share extension | **Built and embedded.** CI asserts the appex ships inside the app, activates on one web URL or up to twenty images, and that the app and the extension claim the same App Group. Whether a share arrives end to end is still a device question. |

## The two rules that matter

Both were learned by getting them wrong:

1. **Every place must carry an Apple place ID** (`I` + 16 hex digits). A guide
   payload built from coordinates renders perfectly on `maps.apple.com` and
   opens with **zero places** in the Maps app. Browser testing gives a false
   pass.
2. **Guides cannot be merged or appended to.** A guide link always creates a new
   guide, even when the name matches one already saved, and there is no read
   access to what the user has. Treat Apple Maps as an output device, not as
   storage — and never build anything that claims to "sync".

One place therefore publishes as a place card, where *Add to Guide* can append
to an existing guide. Several places can only become a new guide.

## Layout

```
lib/src/guide_link.dart   protobuf encoder, base64, chunking at 50
lib/src/ocr.dart          method channel + chrome filtering
lib/src/resolver.dart     PlaceResolver interface, stub and Maps Server stub
ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift   the Vision bridge, the only Swift here
```

## Running it

```bash
flutter test
```

Everything above the platform channel is pure Dart and runs on Windows. The app
itself needs an iOS device: OCR returns `OcrUnavailable` anywhere else.

## The in-app purchase

Guides over three places need a one-time unlock. Non-consumable,
`com.spencerfields.littlebird.unlimited`, $4.99.

The client side is done: StoreKit wired, price read from the store rather than
formatted locally, purchase and restore both failing closed, the non-consumable
completed so it stops being replayed on launch, and a restore entry in the app
bar so a returning customer never has to trip the paywall to find it.

**The product itself must be created in a browser.** The App Store Connect API
refuses it outright — `POST /v1/inAppPurchases` returns *"The resource
'inAppPurchases' does not allow 'CREATE'. Allowed operation is:
GET_INSTANCE"* — and that is the API declining the operation, not a permissions
problem. An Admin key gets the same answer. Same story as creating the app
record.

In App Store Connect → Wren → Monetisation → In-App Purchases → **+**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | Non-Consumable |
| Reference name | `Wren Unlimited Guides` |
| Product ID | `com.spencerfields.littlebird.unlimited` |
| Price | $4.99 (Apple's nearest price point) |
| Display name | Guides of any size |
| Description | Save as many places to a guide as you like, instead of three. One payment, kept for good. |
| Family Sharing | On — costs nothing and reduces support mail |

Also needed before it will sell: the **Paid Applications Agreement** must be
active, and the IAP needs a review screenshot and review notes before it can be
submitted alongside a build.

Until the product exists, `queryProductDetails` returns nothing, `price()` is
null and the sheet falls back to the hardcoded `$4.99` string — so the paywall
still renders, but `buy()` will refuse. That is deliberate: the store failing is
never allowed to grant the unlock.

## Next

1. Mint a Maps identifier and a `.p8` key, confirm `/v1/search` returns `I`+hex
   place ids, then implement `MapsServerResolver` against the Cloudflare Worker
   so the key never ships in the app.
2. Put ten real reel screenshots through Vision and see whether real typography
   behaves like the synthetic fixtures.
3. Share a link into the app from a device and confirm it arrives, now that the app claims the App Group the extension writes into.
4. Turn on the TestFlight job in CI — without a Mac, that is the device-testing
   loop.

## A local annoyance

The project lives in OneDrive, which intermittently locks `build/` and
`ios/Flutter/ephemeral/` mid-build. If Flutter reports it "failed to delete a
directory", delete the folder and re-run. Excluding those two paths from
OneDrive sync avoids it.
