.SYNOPSIS
    Ping IndexNow so Bing / DuckDuckGo / Yandex / Seznam re-crawl changed pages
    within minutes instead of waiting for the next scheduled crawl. (Google does
    not participate in IndexNow — use Search Console's Request Indexing there.)

.DESCRIPTION
    IndexNow works off a key published at the site root:
        https://wren.spencerfields.com/9afd96aa193dc3e072bdd49fb071c0d3.txt
    A single submission to any participating engine is shared with all of them.
    The key is public by design; it proves only that whoever submits also
    controls the site.

    Run after deploying a page change. With no arguments it submits every
    indexable page (the same set as sitemap.xml). Pass -Urls to submit only the
    pages you actually changed — that is the whole point of IndexNow, so prefer
    it over blasting the full list on every edit.

        .\web\indexnow-submit.ps1
        .\web\indexnow-submit.ps1 -Urls "https://wren.spencerfields.com/support.html"

    Note: -Urls takes an array, so the script must be invoked with the call
    operator rather than `pwsh -File`, which would flatten a comma-separated
    list into one string and silently submit a single invalid URL:

        & .\web\indexnow-submit.ps1 -Urls @("https://…/a.html","https://…/b.html")

# Default to the full indexable set, READ FROM sitemap.xml rather than repeated
# here. The list used to be hardcoded, and it went stale exactly as the sitemap
# it was copied from did: four URLs against a site serving 96, with fifteen
# translations submitted to nobody. A second copy of a list is a second thing to
# forget, so there is now only one — regenerate it with `python web/sitemap.py`.
