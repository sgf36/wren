"""Read the real per-territory price of every purchase out of App Store Connect.

    python store/iap_prices.py            # show them
    python store/iap_prices.py --write    # and update store/shot_prices.json

Why this exists. The paywall screenshot showed `Unlock for $4.99` in every
language, including en-GB, because a simulator has no store connection and the
app falls back to its advertised dollar price. A dollar figure on a British or
Brazilian storefront is simply wrong information.

The fix is not to convert the dollar price. **Apple's price points are not
currency conversions** — the UK price of a $4.99 tier is whatever Apple's table
says it is, and a plausible-looking arithmetic result would be a fabrication. So
the numbers come from the price schedule Apple actually holds, and the formatting
comes from CLDR via babel rather than from a hand-built "symbol + number" rule
that puts the symbol on the wrong side in half of Europe.

Regenerate when the price changes. The output is committed so that a screenshot
run needs no App Store Connect credentials.

# Read this table honestly: **an App Store screenshot locale is a language, not a
# storefront.** The `hi` set is shown to every Hindi-language device, in India but
# equally in the UK or the UAE, where the price differs. So no single figure is
# right for every viewer of a language, and this maps each language to the
# storefront most of its buyers actually buy from. That is a real Apple price for
# most viewers and the wrong one for some; it beats a dollar figure that is wrong
# for all of them, and Apple states the true price on the product page and again
# in the purchase sheet.
#
# bn-BD is mapped to India deliberately. Apple sells no paid content in
# Bangladesh — the API returns no price for BGD at all — so every Bengali-reading
# viewer who *can* buy this is buying from a storefront, and overwhelmingly that
# is IND. Using the Indian price there is a decision, not a fallback.
