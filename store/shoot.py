"""Take the App Store screenshots in a simulator, in ten languages.

    python store/shoot.py                 # every language
    python store/shoot.py --locale fr-FR  # one
    python store/shoot.py --no-maps       # skip the Apple Maps payoff shot
    python store/shoot.py --verbose       # every simctl command and its output

macOS only — it drives `xcrun simctl`. Run from the repo root.

**READ store/SCREENSHOTS-RUNBOOK.md BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF THIS.** Six failure
modes have cost about three hours of runner time, and every one of them reported
success at the layer that was checked: an environment variable that is documented
to arrive and does not, a photograph of the home screen that is not flat enough
to fail a flatness test, a photograph of Safari that passed a difference test
against Maps, a device list where none of the devices exist, thirty-one minutes
of output buffered into one burst, and a dollar price on nine foreign
storefronts. The runbook says which check each one defeated.

Why this exists. Screenshots used to be taken by hand on a phone, which meant
they were in English, at that phone's size (an iPhone 16 Pro shoots 1206x2622
and the App Store wants 1290x2796), and had to be retaken from nothing for a
one-word change. One person in the loop caused all three problems.

The three things this script is careful about, each learned the hard way:

  * **Size is verified, not assumed.** Simulator names move between Xcode
    versions, so rather than trusting "iPhone 16 Plus" to be 1290x2796 it takes
    a screenshot and reads the dimensions out of the PNG header. A wrong device
    fails here rather than at upload with IMAGE_INCORRECT_DIMENSIONS. This is
    not hypothetical: **Xcode 26 ships no 6.7-inch iPhone at all**, so the size
    the App Store still demands cannot be produced natively any more and the
    images are downscaled from 1320x2868 instead. See [boot_simulator].
  * **A blank or duplicated frame fails the run.** The specific disaster is a
    run that photographs the home screen six times because the app crashed on
    launch, verifies nothing, uploads, and reports success. Every image is
    checked for being near-uniform, and every pair within a locale for being
    identical.
  * **Nothing is skipped silently.** If the Maps shot cannot be produced the
    script says so, by name, and says what the localised set will contain
    instead.

The status bar is overridden rather than cleaned up afterwards. `simctl status_bar
override` gives Apple's own 9:41 with full bars, which is both what Apple's own
screenshots use and the end of the "<- TestFlight" label that had to be painted
out of the hand-taken set.

    environment variable through `simctl launch`, and on 17 August 2026 it
    delivered nothing: every screenshot in the run rendered the app's
    "no scene called" screen with an empty name. The variable is still passed —
    it costs nothing and may work on other Xcode versions — but the scene is now
    also written to a file the app reads, because a file either exists with the
    right contents or does not, and both cases are visible from here.

    Returns None if the container cannot be found, which is not fatal on its own:
    the environment route may still work, and the app says which one fed it.
