"""Send an App Bundle to a Google Play track, or to Internal app sharing.

    python store/play_upload.py --check
    python store/play_upload.py --aab <path>                  # internal track
    python store/play_upload.py --aab <path> --share          # install link

Four REST calls around an "edit": create, upload the bundle, assign it to a
track, commit. Talking to the API directly rather than through fastlane keeps
the one credential that can publish this app away from a third-party toolchain.

**A first release does not reach a phone on the day it is built, and there is
no way round it.** A track release on an app that has never been published goes
to "Pending publication" until Google reviews it, and the tester opt-in link
does not exist until that finishes.

`--share` is *not* the escape hatch it is in Easy-Post's copy of this tool.
Measured on 2026-08-21 against this package, Internal app sharing refuses with

    400 FAILED_PRECONDITION
    UploadException: NOT_PUBLISHED [[]] (com.spencerfields.littlebird)

so it wants a published release too. It is kept here because it works once the
app has one, and because the next person will otherwise read Easy-Post's note
and expect it to work today.

What unblocks the first publication is the App content declarations — data
safety, content rating, target audience, ads, the privacy policy URL — which
have no API and must be completed in the Console. Until they are, nothing
reaches a phone through Play by any route.

Production is not offered. Releasing to the public should be a deliberate act
in the Console, not a flag on the script that also does routine test uploads.

Credentials are Easy-Post's Play service account, which reaches this app too.
See that repo's PLAY-SETUP.md.
