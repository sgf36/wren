"""Push Wren's App Store listing from metadata_en_GB.json (plus translations).

Checks Apple's length limits before sending, because App Store Connect rejects
an over-length field with a generic error and no indication of which one.

    python store/push_metadata.py            # primary locale only
    python store/push_metadata.py --all      # every locale with a file
    python store/push_metadata.py --check    # lengths only, sends nothing

Fields that are the same in every language — the two URLs, the app's name —
live in common.json and are merged in, so a URL change is one edit rather than
fifty and the locale files hold only what a translator touched.

Reads the App Manager key from the signing folder. Creates nothing that cannot
be edited afterwards in App Store Connect.
