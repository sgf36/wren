/// It replaces a single code compiled into the build. That version had two
/// faults that mattered. Everyone shared one code, so one leak unlocked the app
/// for anyone who saw it and the only remedy was shipping a new build; and the
/// code arrived through `--dart-define` from a CI secret, so rotating it meant
/// a release.
///
/// Why a server is involved at all, given the app otherwise has none: single
/// use cannot be decided on the device. A code could be signed and verified
/// offline against an embedded public key — no network, unlimited codes — but
/// nothing on a phone can know that a code has already been spent on a
/// different phone. "Already redeemed" is a fact with exactly one home.
///
/// The network is touched once, when a code is entered. What comes back is an
/// Ed25519-signed token naming this device, kept locally and checked offline
/// from then on. Two consequences worth having: the app never phones home at
/// launch, and pointing it at a look-alike server gains nothing, because a
/// forged approval cannot carry a valid signature.
///
/// A code carries a role, which is inside the signed payload. Most codes are
/// [CompRole.unlock] and do exactly what is described above. A few are
/// [CompRole.admin], which is the same unlock plus the right to issue and
/// withdraw codes from inside the app — see `admin_codes.dart`. The role is
/// read from the token rather than remembered as a flag, so writing one into
/// app storage by hand is not a promotion; and the server re-reads it from its
/// own table before doing anything administrative, so this claim decides what
/// the app *shows*, never what the server *allows*.
