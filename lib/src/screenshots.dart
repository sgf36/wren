/// The store screenshots, defined as scenes the real app can be put into.

/// Screenshots used to be taken by hand on a phone, which meant they were in
/// one language, at whatever size that phone happens to be — an iPhone 16 Pro
/// shoots 1206x2622 and the App Store wants 1290x2796 — and had to be retaken
/// from scratch for a one-word change. All three problems are the same problem:
/// a person in the loop.
///
/// So a scene is a set of fixtures plus, sometimes, one of the app's own
/// overlays to open. Everything below builds the **real** [CapturePage]; nothing
/// here reimplements a card, a dialog or a sheet. That is the whole point. A
/// harness that drew its own version of the paywall would keep producing
/// handsome screenshots of a paywall the app no longer has.
///
/// Driven from `store/shoot.py`, which boots a simulator of exactly the right
/// size, sets the device language, and launches this build once per scene with
/// `SIMCTL_CHILD_WREN_SCENE` naming the one it wants.
