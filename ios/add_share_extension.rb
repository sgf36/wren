# change. There is no Mac and no Xcode on the machine this app is written on, and
# hand-editing project.pbxproj is how that file gets quietly corrupted: it is a
# graph with UUID cross-references, not a config file. A tool that understands
# the format does it deterministically, and the diff never has to be reviewed by
# eye.
#
# Idempotent: run it twice and the second run does nothing, so it is safe in a
# workflow that may retry.

# gives it one. Runner never did: no target in the project pointed at an
# entitlements file, so the app had no right to open the container the extension
# writes into. That failure is silent by construction — containerURL returns nil
# for a group you do not hold, and a nil container is exactly what AppDelegate
# sees when nothing was shared. The extension would accept a share, write it,
# and the app would find an empty inbox.
#
# Done ahead of the "already present" check rather than inside the creation
# branch, because the extension target existed for weeks before anyone noticed
# the app side was missing, and a fix that only runs when the target is created
# would never have run at all.
